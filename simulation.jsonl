{"query": "Could you tell me more about the security evaluation process for products? Specifically, what is the name of the evaluation that assesses the robustness of a product's security implementation?", "response": "The security evaluation process you are referring to that assesses the robustness of a product's security implementation is commonly known as the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, or simply \"Common Criteria\" (CC). \n\nThe Common Criteria is an international standard (ISO/IEC 15408) used to evaluate the security properties of information technology products. This framework allows product developers to specify the security functionality and assurance measures their products implement, and for evaluators to assess whether these measures are correctly implemented and robust enough to handle potential security threats.\n\nThe evaluation process within the Common Criteria involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Security Target (ST):** The product developer prepares this document, which describes the specific security functionalities and assurances that the product claims to provide. It serves as a baseline for evaluation.\n\n2. **Protection Profiles (PP):** These are standardized sets of security requirements that apply to categories of products. A product can be evaluated against relevant PPs to demonstrate adherence to those predefined security objectives.\n\n3. **Evaluation Assurance Levels (EALs):** These levels (ranging from EAL1 to EAL7) indicate the depth and rigor of the evaluation. A higher level indicates a more thorough assessment process. Each level includes a defined set of assurance components related to design, development, testing, and vulnerability assessment.\n\n4. **Evaluation Process:** An accredited evaluation laboratory conducts the testing based on the criteria specified in the ST or against applicable PPs, and the product is assessed for meets the claimed security properties.\n\n5. **Certification:** Upon successful evaluation, a Certification Body, such as a national governmental organization, issues a certificate confirming the product\u2019s compliance with specified security assurance requirements.\n\nThis process is widely recognized and used in many countries for evaluating and certifying security-critical IT products, ensuring they meet specified security standards.", "context": "{'citations': None}"}

It provides guidelines and best practices for securing the entire platform, including hardware and software components.\n\n2. **Core Objectives:** A PSM typically focuses on key areas such as access control, data protection, secure boot processes, firmware integrity, and secure communication protocols. These models aim to establish a trusted computing base that ensures the overall security posture of the platform.\n\n3. **Components:** PSMs often define specific security functions or features that the platform should implement, such as encryption, authentication, secure storage, and secure execution environments. These components help safeguard user data and protect the system from unauthorized access or malicious attacks.\n\n4. **Compatibility with Evaluation Frameworks:** While the PSM itself is not an evaluation framework like the Common Criteria, products designed in accordance with a robust PSM may be better positioned to meet the requirements of security evaluations. By adhering to a comprehensive security model, developers can ensure their platforms have foundational security principles that align with formal evaluation processes.\n\n5. **Industry Frameworks:** Various industries might adopt their own platform security models tailored to their specific needs. For example, the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a hardware-based approach to platform security often incorporated into PSMs for added robustness.\n\nOverall, a Platform Security Model helps ensure security by offering clear guidelines and standards for building secure systems and applications from the ground up, focusing specifically on the integrity of the platform as a whole.
